# Joker
Implementation of the famous lottery game


The user creates a new ticket for the Joker game. 
He can choose the numbers himself or he can also ask for the numbers to be automatically generated.
When a new ticket is created, the user is informed of the cost of the ticket based on the how many numbers he picked.

You can ask from the program to issue a new winning ticket and check whether you have won or not.
For every winning ticket the program also collects about the numbers with the most and least occurences.
